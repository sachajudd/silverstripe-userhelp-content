This site is a user-focused reference targeted at editors and administrators who create and manage content on SilverStripe CMS websites.
This guide applies to version 4.x of the CMS (all releases in the SilverStripe 4 release line).

This User help guide also covers a number of [modules](https://addons.silverstripe.org)
which may or may not be installed for your site. Refer to the intro for each chapter to find out the prerequisites for using a feature.
