# Optional CMS features

SilverStripe CMS can be highly customised using many of the modules listed in the [SilverStripe CMS module directory](https://addons.silverstripe.org).
This section highlights some of the CMS features provided by the [SilverStripe CMS supported modules](https://www.silverstripe.org/software/addons/supported-modules-definition/).
In each case you'll need to ensure you have the module installed on your website in order to use the features described here.
